# For a simple planar detector, we can use exact analytical expressions for the fields:
# For more complicated geometries, we can use the numerical solutions using _SIMION

# Here you define the event structure - this should be done first: 
# How many interactions maximum in an event, how many samples in the traces, how many segments...
# EDIT THIS PART!!!
ADL_EVENT		ConfigFiles/EVENT.txt

# you dont want to use a response function for your preamp,
# so we can set the convolution to a dummy function:
# This setup file will invert channel 0 ("core")
ADL_CONVL_DUMMY		ConfigFiles/CONV_SAMPLES.txt

# Here you define the drift velocity parameters
# For Germanium, see:
# Bruyneel et al NIM A 569 (2006) 764-773
# Mihailescu et al NIM A 447 (2000) 350-360
ADL_DRIFT_GE		ConfigFiles/DRIFT_GE.txt

# Here we define how events will be read in and written out:
# Choices are binary "BIN", text "TXT", dino's tkt "TKT" (write only)
# I selected txt to begin with:
ADL_READWRITE		ConfigFiles/READWRITE_TXT.txt

# Applies a fast filter to estimate the trigger time of the event:
# (not so important : commented out)
# ADL_TIME_FAST		ConfigFiles/TIME_FAST.txt

# Here the settings for the routine which finally does all the work:
# These settings should normally not be altered, but the library always has to be setup:

# This will introduce the TRAPPING
